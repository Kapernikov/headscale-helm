## Client Container

This Helm chart includes an optional client container that runs a Tailscale client (`tailscaled`) alongside the Headscale server. This client automatically registers with the Headscale server using a pre-authenticated key, simplifying the initial setup for testing or demonstration purposes.

The client container is configured to:
- Start the `tailscaled` daemon in the background.
- Use `tailscale up` to connect to the Headscale server.
- Optionally advertise routes to act as a subnet router.
- Optionally advertise itself as an exit node.

You can enable or disable the client container via the `client.enabled` value in `values.yaml`. Configure subnet routing with `client.advertiseRoutes` and exit node functionality with `client.exitNode`.

**Warning:** Using the client as an exit node (or advertising `0.0.0.0/0` and `::/0` routes) exposes all Kubernetes pods and services to nodes using this exit node. This is usually not recommended. Only enable this if you understand the security implications.

### DaemonSet Mode

Setting `client.daemonset=true` deploys the client as a DaemonSet with `hostNetwork: true`, giving every node direct tailnet connectivity. This is useful when nodes need to reach tailnet IPs directly (e.g. pulling images from a private registry on the tailnet).

**Warning:** DaemonSet mode uses host networking and runs on every node, directly modifying the host network stack. This means:

- The tailscale interface is created on the **host**, not inside a pod network namespace.
- By default, tailscale's `--accept-dns` flag is **true**, which rewrites the host's `/etc/resolv.conf` to use tailscale's DNS. On nodes without split-DNS support (e.g. **Talos Linux** or any distribution not using `systemd-resolved`), **this will break cluster DNS and can make nodes unreachable**. Set `client.acceptDns: false` to prevent this.
- IP forwarding (`net.ipv4.ip_forward`) is already enabled on Kubernetes nodes, so the chart does not set it in DaemonSet mode.
- **Route advertisement in DaemonSet mode:** When `client.advertiseRoutes` is set together with `client.daemonset=true`, every node will advertise the same routes as a subnet router. Headscale will pick one node as the primary router and use the others as failover. This is usually not what you want — it adds redundant subnet routers without real load balancing. If you need subnet routing, consider using the default Deployment mode (single replica) instead.

### accept-dns (`client.acceptDns`)

By default, tailscale enables `--accept-dns`, meaning it will configure the node to use tailscale's DNS resolver (MagicDNS). When running in Deployment mode (the default) this only affects the pod's network namespace and is generally harmless.

**In DaemonSet mode, this modifies the host's DNS configuration.** If your nodes use `systemd-resolved`, tailscale integrates cleanly via split-DNS. If your nodes do **not** use `systemd-resolved` (e.g. Talos Linux, Alpine-based nodes, many minimal distributions), tailscale will overwrite `/etc/resolv.conf`, breaking all non-tailscale DNS resolution including cluster DNS.

**Recommendation:** When using DaemonSet mode, always set `client.acceptDns: false` unless you have verified that your nodes support split-DNS via `systemd-resolved`.

## Persistence

Headscale requires persistence to store its database and noise private key. This chart configures a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) to ensure that Headscale's data is not lost across pod restarts or redeployments.

By default, persistence is enabled with a 1Gi volume. You can configure the size, access modes, and storage class through the `persistence` section in `values.yaml`. Set `persistence.existingClaim` to reuse a pre-created PVC. Data is stored at `/var/lib/headscale` inside the container and this mount path is fixed by the chart.

## Ingress

The chart provides an option to expose the Headscale service via an Ingress resource. This allows you to access your Headscale instance from outside the Kubernetes cluster using a domain name.

You can enable Ingress by setting `ingress.enabled` to `true` in `values.yaml`. You can also configure the Ingress class, hosts, TLS settings, and annotations to customize its behavior for your environment.

Important: the Headscale `server_url` must match the external hostname clients use (typically your Ingress host). This chart auto-populates `config.server_url` from the first `ingress.hosts[].host` when `ingress.enabled` is true and `config.server_url` is empty. If you set `config.server_url` explicitly, ensure it matches your Ingress hostname and scheme (https when TLS is enabled), otherwise clients may fail to connect with noise/decrypt errors.

WebSockets must be supported by your ingress for Headscale to work correctly. For ingress-nginx, the chart defaults include annotations enabling WebSockets and long-lived timeouts:

```yaml
ingress:
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-websocket: "true"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: "3600"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-send-timeout: "3600"
```
If you use another ingress controller, configure equivalent settings to allow WebSocket upgrades and long read/send timeouts.

## Extra DNS Records

Headscale can serve additional MagicDNS entries by pointing `dns.extra_records_path` at a JSON file. The chart wires this up through `extraDnsRecords`, letting you either supply records inline or reference an existing ConfigMap.

- Set `extraDnsRecords.enabled=true` to mount a JSON file and set `dns.extra_records_path`.
- When `extraDnsRecords.configMap.create=true` (default), the chart renders the list under `extraDnsRecords.records` into a ConfigMap.
- To reuse an existing ConfigMap, set `extraDnsRecords.configMap.create=false` and provide the `name`/`key` that contain your JSON payload.

Inline example:

```yaml
extraDnsRecords:
  enabled: true
  path: /etc/headscale/extra-dns-records.json
  records:
    - name: grafana.internal.example.com
      type: A
      value: 100.64.0.10
    - name: prometheus.internal.example.com
      type: A
      value: 100.64.0.10
```

Referencing an existing ConfigMap:

```yaml
extraDnsRecords:
  enabled: true
  configMap:
    create: false
    name: shared-dns-records
    key: records.json
  path: /etc/headscale/extra-dns-records.json
```

## Headscale UI

This chart can optionally deploy the community Headscale UI (`gurucomputing/headscale-ui`).

- Enable by setting `ui.enabled` to `true`.
- A separate `Service` named `<release>-headscale-ui` is created on port `ui.service.port` (default 80).
- When `ingress.enabled=true`, the UI is exposed on the same hostname as Headscale under a subpath (default `/web`). The UI has its own `Ingress` resource that targets the same host as the main ingress, with its path set from `ui.ingress.path`.
- `HEADSCALE_URL` defaults to the external scheme+host from the main Ingress when Ingress is enabled; otherwise it falls back to the internal cluster service. You can override via `ui.headscaleUrl`.
- Optional UI persistence creates a PVC and mounts it at `ui.persistence.mountPath`. Set `ui.persistence.existingClaim` to reuse a pre-created PVC.

Example snippet:

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  hosts:
    - host: headscale.example.com
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: ImplementationSpecific

ui:
  enabled: true
  # Optional override; by default uses https://headscale.example.com when TLS is enabled
  # headscaleUrl: "https://headscale.example.com"
  ingress:
  path: /web
  pathType: ImplementationSpecific
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    mountPath: /var/lib/headscale-ui
    size: 5Gi
```

## Local Testing with kind

For a quick local smoke test you can use [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io). The repository provides `hack/kind-smoke.sh`, which spins up a temporary kind cluster, installs the chart (with sample extra DNS records), verifies readiness, and tears everything down by default.

```console
$ hack/kind-smoke.sh
```

Use `hack/kind-smoke.sh --keep` to retain the cluster for further inspection.

Pass `--with-client` if you also want to deploy the optional Tailscale sidecar and verify the hook/job flow:

```console
$ hack/kind-smoke.sh --with-client
```

## Disruption Budgets

Every workload deployed by the chart (server, UI, and optional client) now includes a PodDisruptionBudget to describe how voluntary disruptions should be handled. By default each budget sets `maxUnavailable: 1`, which lets Kubernetes evict the single replica when needed (e.g., for node drains) without blocking cluster operations. You can toggle or adjust these budgets through `podDisruptionBudget`, `ui.podDisruptionBudget`, and `client.podDisruptionBudget` in `values.yaml`. Set `enabled: false` to skip creating a budget or provide your own `minAvailable`/`maxUnavailable` values to better match your topology.
